### Assumptions made
- Image upload is demonstrative and file contents are not utilizied
- Covers some basic tax queries

### Placeholder Features and How it Can be Expanded
- **Knowledge**: Set of tax keywords which can be replaced with an AI model for the future
- **File Upload**: Doesn't use the contents of the file other than display, could parse information from it and provide it for analysis

### Areas for Future Improvement
- Integrating a backend so it can cover more scenarios
- Adding storage to store user chat history if the user wants to close the tab and come back to it
- More integration into a larger site for the UI
